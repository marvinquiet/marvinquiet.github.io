Here is a list of software packages and web pages develped by ME.

### Bioconductor package

- [LRcell](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/LRcell.html) (Differential **cell** type change analysis using **L**ogitstic/linear **R**egression): LRcell is developed to identify specific (sub-)cell types that drives the changes observed in a bulk RNA-seq differential gene expression experiment. 

### Web server

- [BARTweb](https://github.com/zanglab/BARTweb_frontend)(**B**inding **A**nalysis for **R**egulation of **T**ranscription **web**): A web server hosted for performing BART analysis, which is a bioinformatics tool for predicting functional factors (including transcription factors and chromatin regulators) that bind at cis-regulatory regions to regulate gene expression in human or mouse, taking a query gene list or a ChIP-seq dataset as input.

#### Research pipleines

- Explorations on strategies of constructing reference dataset for celltyping. Our paper is currently under review and once it gets published, I will put the code link here. [project link](https://github.com/marvinquiet/RefConstruction_supervisedCelltyping)
