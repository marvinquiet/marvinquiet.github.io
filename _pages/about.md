Greetings, welcome to my page! I am [Wenjing Ma](https://marvinquiet.github.io/cv/), a first-year Ph.D. student in [the CSI Program at Emory University](https://www.cs.emory.edu/graduate/general-information/). I obtained my master and bachelor's degrees both in Computer Science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT). I was a software engineer after graduation, and thanks to a book - *The Gene: An Intimate History*, I realized the gap between traditional biology research and advanced computing technology. It led me to Bioinformatics area, to which I can contribute my computer science skills.

Now, I am doing rotation projects with [Professor Zhaohui "Steve" Qin](https://www.sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/#!ZQIN4) on single-cell genomics data analysis, and I wish to continue this work with Professor Qin in the future. Before joining Emory, I was a visiting scholar in [Zanglab](http://faculty.virginia.edu/zanglab/) at the University of Virginia advised by [Professor Chongzhi Zang](http://faculty.virginia.edu/zanglab/people.htm), and I learned a lot about Next-Generation Sequencing protocols and related analysis methodologies.  During my stay at Zanglab, I developed a web tool named [BARTweb](http://bartweb.org/) based on a previous work. Please feel free to upload a gene list or a genomic binding profile to make a transcription factors prediction!

**My current research interests are (1) method developments in single-cell data analysis, including scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq,  (2) detection of key cell type involved in bulk experiments, and  (3) transcriptional regulatory mechanism.  If you happen to be interested in the above areas, please shoot me an e-mail at [wenjing.ma@emory.edu](wenjing.ma@emory.edu)!**
