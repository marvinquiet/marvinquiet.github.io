Greetings, welcome to my page! I am [Wenjing Ma](https://marvinquiet.github.io/cv/), a fourth-year Ph.D. student in [the CSI Program at Emory University](https://www.cs.emory.edu/graduate/general-information/). I obtained my master and bachelor's degrees both in Computer Science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT). I was a software engineer after graduation, and thanks to a book - *The Gene: An Intimate History*, I realized the gap between traditional biology research and advanced computing technology. It led me to Bioinformatics area, to which I can contribute my computer science skills.

I am working with [Dr. Hao Wu](http://www.haowulab.org/) on cell identification for single cell genomics data. We have published a [benchmarking paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02480-2) on evaluating the strategies of constructing reference dataset for supervised cell identification. Recently, we have submitted another method paper named [Cellcano](https://marvinquiet.github.io/Cellcano/), which identifies cell types for scATAC-seq data in a supervised manner. After accurately identifying the cell types, we could acquire the cell-type-specific marker genes information and apply them on bulk differential experession experiments to discover cell-type-specific enrichments using [LRcell](https://github.com/marvinquiet/LRcell). This is a rotation project supervised by [Dr. Zhaohui "Steve" Qin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=9F-Jk74AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). 

Before joining Emory, I was a visiting scholar in [Zanglab](http://faculty.virginia.edu/zanglab/) at the University of Virginia supervised by [Dr. Chongzhi Zang](http://faculty.virginia.edu/zanglab/people.htm). During my stay at Zanglab, I developed a web sever named [BARTweb](http://bartweb.org/) based on a previous work named *BART*. Please feel free to upload a gene list or a genomic binding profile to make predictions on potential regulating transcription factors.

**My current research interest is applying advanced deep learning techniques in genomics data, including but not limited to scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, scDNA methylation, spatial transcriptomics, etc. In the meantime, I enjoy collaborating with biologists to discover the role of cell-free DNA and mechanisms for neurodevelopmental disorder. **If you happen to be interested in my work, please shoot me an e-mail at [wenjing.ma@emory.edu](wenjing.ma@emory.edu) and I am more than happy to discuss!
