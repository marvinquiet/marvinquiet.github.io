I am Wenjing Ma.

I used to be a software engineer. Although being a coder is the coolest thing in the world, I still wish to do more. Therefore, I chose to pivot to Bioinformatics to see whether I could do something big.

Currently I am a visiting scholar at [zanglab](http://faculty.virginia.edu/zanglab/)@University of Virginia, and I plan to apply for a Ph.D. degree. Combining computer science with biology, RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ChIP-seq and other sequencing skills are currently my focus. Also, I developed a **web surface** combining [MARGE](http://cistrome.org/MARGE/index.html) and [BART](http://faculty.virginia.edu/zanglab/bart/) together to compute the most possible enhancer, therefore, predict the transcriptional factors. After our server is set, my website will open to public in no time. Let's look forward to it!
