Greetings, and welcome to my page! 

I am Wenjing Ma, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Michigan, where I am fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Xiang Zhou](https://xiangzhou.github.io/) in the Department of Biostatistics (now a Professor of Statistics and Data Science at Yale University). **I will soon be joining the [School of Artificial Intelligence at CUHK-Shenzhen](https://sai.cuhk.edu.cn/) as a Tenure-track Assistant Professor.**

Prior to UMich, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Informatics from Emory University in 2023, under the supervision of [Dr. Hao Wu](http://www.haowulab.org/) in the Department of Biostatistics. Before that, I was a visiting scholar in [Dr. Chongzhi Zang](https://zanglab.github.io/index.htm)'s lab at the University of Virginia. I received both my master and bachelor degrees in Computer Science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) and briefly worked as a software engineer after graduation. Thanks to a book - *The Gene: An Intimate History*, I realized the gap between traditional biology research and advanced computing technologies, which led me toward Computational Biology, Biostatistics & Bioinformatics fields where I can unite my computing background with rigorous statistical training.

My research focuses on **developing AI-powered-by-statistics methods for accurate, intepretable, and scalable analysis of omics data**, including single-cell, spatial,  multi-omics, etc. By integrating biological priors into computational frameworks, I have passion in understanding how cells, tissues, and organs evolve during development and disease progression. I enjoy collaborating with biologists and clinicians to translate these methods into meaningful biomedical and clinical insights.

I am currently **seeking motivated research assistants, Ph.D. students, and postdocs who are passionate about advancing AI-powered-by-statistics methods in biological research.** If you are interested in developing  innovative methods, tools or software to solve real-world biological questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at [mawenjing1993@gmail.com](mawenjing1993@gmail.com) and I am more than happy to discuss!
