I am [Wenjing Ma](https://marvinquiet.github.io/cv/).

I used to be a software engineer. Although being a coder is the coolest thing in the world, I still wish to do more. Therefore, I transferred to Bioinformatics to see whether I could do something big and make impact.

Currently I am a visiting scholar at [zanglab](http://faculty.virginia.edu/zanglab/)@University of Virginia, and I plan to apply for a Ph.D. degree. Combining computer science with biology, RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ChIP-seq and other sequencing skills are my focus. Also, I developed a **web surface** combining [MARGE](http://cistrome.org/MARGE/index.html) and [BART](http://faculty.virginia.edu/zanglab/bart/) together to compute the most possible enhancers, therefore, predict where transcriptional factors will bind to. 

With the help of [Neal](https://github.com/nmagee) from UVa SOMRC Group, we finally deployed it on the server. You can try it on [HERE](http://bartweb.uvasomrc.io/) now! 

Any suggestions to this webpage are welcome! Feel free to open issue tickets in my [Github Repo](https://github.com/marvinquiet/BART-WEB).
