I am [Wenjing Ma](https://marvinquiet.github.io/cv/).

I used to be a software engineer. Although being a coder is the coolest thing in the world, I still wish to do more. Therefore, I chose to pivot to Bioinformatics to see whether I could do something big.

Currently I am a visiting scholar at [zanglab](http://faculty.virginia.edu/zanglab/)@University of Virginia, and I plan to apply for a Ph.D. degree. Combining computer science with biology, RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ChIP-seq and other sequencing skills are my focus. Also, I developed a **web surface** combining [MARGE](http://cistrome.org/MARGE/index.html) and [BART](http://faculty.virginia.edu/zanglab/bart/) together to compute the most possible enhancers, therefore, predict where transcriptional factors will bind to. After our server is set, it will open to public in no time. Let's look forward to it!
