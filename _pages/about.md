I am [Wenjing Ma](https://marvinquiet.github.io/cv/).

I used to be a software engineer. Although being a coder is the coolest thing in the world, I still wish to do more. Therefore, I transferred to Bioinformatics to see whether I could do something big and make impact.

Currently, I am a visiting scholar at [zanglab](http://faculty.virginia.edu/zanglab/)@University of Virginia, and I plan to apply for a Ph.D. degree in Bioinformatics or Computational Biology. Through these months of traning, I am now familiar with how to use high-throughput genomics data analysis tool, such as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and other sequencing technology. Meanwhile, I also a **web surface** combining [MARGE](http://cistrome.org/MARGE/index.html) and [BART](http://faculty.virginia.edu/zanglab/bart/) together leveraging public ChIP-seq datasets and H3K27ac profiles to predict functional transcription factors when given a gene set of a ChIP-seq mapping reads. 

With the help of [Neal](https://github.com/nmagee) from UVa SOMRC Group, we finally deployed it on our domain. You can try it  [HERE](http://bartweb.org/). Any suggestions to this webpage are welcome! Feel free to open issue tickets in my [Github Repo](https://github.com/marvinquiet/BART-WEB).

My current research interest includes the gene regulatory mechanism, single cell data analysis, and bioinformatics tool development. If you have any questions regarding my academic experiences, please feel free to contact me at <mawenjing1993@gmail.com>.
