Greetings, welcome to my page! I am Wenjing Ma, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Michigan, where I am fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Xiang Zhou](https://www.xzlab.org/team.html) from the Department of Biostatistics. My current research invovles statistical modeling and development of computational methods for analyzing single-cell genomics data, including but not limited to scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, spatial omics, etc. Prior to joining UM, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Informatics (BMI track) from Emory University in 2023. During my doctoral studies, I am very fortunate to be trained by [Dr. Hao Wu](http://www.haowulab.org/) on developing supervised methods for accurately identifying cell types for single-cell genomics data. Before joining Emory, I was a visiting scholar in [Dr. Chongzhi Zang](https://zanglab.github.io/index.htm)'s lab at University of Virginia. 

I obtained my master and bachelor's degrees both in Computer Science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) and I was a software engineer after graduation. Thanks to a book - *The Gene: An Intimate History*, I realized the gap between traditional biology research and advanced computing technology. It led me to Bioinformatics and Biostatistics area, where I can contribute my computer science skills.

I enjoyed developing useful methods/tools for analyzing single-cell genomics data and collaborating with biologists to discover the mechanisms of biological processes and potential treatments. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to send me an e-mail at [mawenjing1993@gmail.com](mawenjing1993@gmail.com) and I am more than happy to discuss!
