I am [Wenjing Ma](https://marvinquiet.github.io/cv/).

I used to be a software engineer. Although being a coder is the coolest thing in the world, I still wish to do more. Therefore, I chose to pivot to Bioinformatics to see whether I could do something big.

Currently I am a visiting scholar at [zanglab](http://faculty.virginia.edu/zanglab/)@University of Virginia, and I plan to apply for a Ph.D. degree. Combining computer science with biology, RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ChIP-seq and other sequencing skills are currently my focus. Also, I developed a **web surface** combining [MARGE](http://cistrome.org/MARGE/index.html) and [BART](http://faculty.virginia.edu/zanglab/bart/) together to compute the most possible enhancer, therefore, predict the transcriptional factors. After our server is set, it will open to public in no time. Let's look forward to it!
